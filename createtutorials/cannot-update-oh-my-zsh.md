# oh-my-zsh Can't update

It looks like the OMZ folder is missing the .git directory. Maybe it got deleted or something. Try reinstalling it by removing the directory and cloning it back in the same place:

    NOTE: before running rm -rf "$ZSH" make sure the value of $ZSH is correct. It should point to the directory where you installed Oh My Zsh, which by default is at $HOME/.oh-my-zsh

rm -rf "$ZSH"
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh.git "$ZSH"

You should be able to update again after that.
