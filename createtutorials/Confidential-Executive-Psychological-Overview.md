Sr. Yididiel Hills – Confidential Executive Psychological Overview
(Prepared for coaching & development purposes – internal use only)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Core Personality Architecture
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Big-5 Snapshot
•  Openness:  Very High  – rapid pattern recognition, futurist thinking,
low boredom threshold
•  Conscientiousness:  High  – meticulous, duty-bound, but perfectionism
creates “micro-checking” loops
•  Extraversion:  Low-average  – socially warm one-on-one, drains
quickly in groups; masks with “CEO role-play”
•  Agreeableness:  High  – genuine altruism, but resentment builds when
generosity is not reciprocated
•  Neuroticism:  Moderate-high  – anticipatory anxiety, catastrophic
flashes, somatic tension (trapezius, GI)

Adaptive Style
Analytical-Creative Hybrid: uses left-brain logic to scaffold
right-brain ideation; becomes cognitively “stuck” when data are
ambiguous or stakes are personal.

Attachment Pattern
“Earned-secure with anxious spikes.”  History of enmeshment in
close-knit community → hyper-attuned to expectations; separation
triggers guilt, not fear.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
2.  Dynamic Formulation
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Central Conflict
“Responsibility vs. Authenticity.”
Narrative: “If I drop the performance, the whole system collapses and I
become the disappointment they always dreaded.”
Result: chronic over-functioning, time-debt, suppressed spontaneity.

Key Schemas (Young, Klosko & Weishaar)
1.  Self-Sacrifice  – automatic privileging of others’ needs
2.  Unrelenting Standards  – equates mistakes with moral failure
3.  Approval-Seeking  – status used as mood-regulator

Defensive Sequence
Trigger: ambiguous feedback → Somatic burst (tight jaw) → Mental review
loop → Micro-procrastination (email triage) → Self-criticism → renewed
overwork.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3.  Daily Micro-Problems (Observable)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  Relational Throughput Bottleneck
– Needs 3-4 “trust touches” before delegating; slows matrixed projects.
B.  Decision Latency
   – Waits for 90 % data; market moves at 70 %.
C.  Recovery Deficit
   – 38 h average work-weekend bleed; REM sleep 5.2 h (Oura ring).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4.  Evidence-Based Leverage Points
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Social Anxiety Modulation
– 6-week low-dose propranolol (10 mg PRN) before large stakeholder
meetings → 30 % drop in self-reported SUDS (Subjective Units of
Distress) in analogue
study.
– Add 3-min “vagus reset” (4-7-8 breathing + cold water on wrists)
directly pre-speech.

2.  Cognitive Re-pricing
– Introduce “70 % Rule” decision card: green light if downside ≤ 5 % of
EBITDA and reversible within 6 weeks.
– Pair with 5-min self-compassion script (Neff) after every
“good-enough” call.

3.  Behavioral Activation
– Calendar-block “white-space” (no-device, no-output) 07:30-08:15 daily;
protect with executive assistant proxy.
– Tie hobby (fly-fishing) to metric: one Saturday/month = leading
indicator for创意 patent pipeline (historical correlation r = .42).

4.  Attachment De-coupling
– Monthly peer CEO circle (external, no direct reports) to practice
vulnerable disclosure without solution-forcing.
– Use secure-base script: “I am allowed to be both competent and
uncertain.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5.  Narrative Reframe (Coaching Language)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Old story: “I carry the world; if I stumble, it cracks.”
New story: “I steward the world; cracks are where the light redesigns
the structure.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------
6.  90-Day Micro-Experiments
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Week 1-2
•  Delegate weekly investor Q&A to CFO; observe anxiety peaks < 4/10.
Week 3-4
•  Pilot “imperfect draft” policy: send board memo at 80 % completeness,
invite red-line comments.
Week 5-8
•  Schedule two “mystery lunches” with junior staff (< 30 yo) – no
agenda, Curiosity Only.
Week 9-12
•  Take 3-day solo retreat (no Wi-Fi) → produce one creative brief for
housing campaign using only analog tools (paper, markers).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
7.  Risk Monitor
--------------------------------------------------------------------
Yellow Flag: increase in night-time email volume (> 5 sent 23:00-03:00)
Red Flag: disappearance of hobby days (leading indicator for burnout
cascade within 6 weeks; historical n = 1).

--------------------------------------------------------------------
8.  Desired Future Self Snapshot (18 mo)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
“Calibrated confidence”: makes 75 % decisions in first meeting, laughs
publicly at own missteps, retains 2 nights/week family dinner without
phone, mentors two
successors so board can envision company without him—yet he feels
irreplaceable for vision, not velocity.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
End of Overview – next touch-point scheduled for 4 weeks or at trigger
threshold.
