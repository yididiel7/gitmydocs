Technical guide for setting up a Python project for unit testing
To optimize this as a prompt for a local LLM, we need to shift from a
"description" to a "command" that demands a structured, technical
output.

Here are three professional versions depending on how much detail you
want:

### Option 1: The "Architect" Prompt (Structured & Detailed)

"""Act as a Senior DevOps Engineer. Provide a comprehensive,
step-by-step technical guide for setting up a Python project using
**uv**. The guide must include:
1. Directory initialization and `uv init` commands.
2. Instructions for automatic Python version management and `.venv`
creation via `uv`.
3. Specific activation commands for both Unix and Windows environments.
4. The workflow for adding `pytest` as a dev dependency.
5. A verification step to ensure the environment is correctly configured
before running unit tests.
6. A verification step to ensure the environment is correctly configured
before running module tests."""
---

### Option 2: The "Developer Quick-Start" (Concise & Script-Focused)

"Generate a README-style guide for a Python project using **uv** for
dependency management. Focus on the workflow for unit and module
testing: include commands for environment setup, venv activation, and
verifying the Python installation. Ensure the final step demonstrates
running `pytest` via `uv run` to maintain environment sync."
Learn how to create a Python project using **uv** for dependency
management. Focus on the workflow for running unit tests in python with
the unittest module and assert methods and also the test driven
development concept.
---

### Option 3: The "Script Generator" (Code-First)

"Write a shell script/tutorial that automates the setup of a Python
testing environment using **uv**. Include the logic to create the
project, initialize the virtual environment, install module testing
dependencies, and a 'smoke test' command to confirm Python and the venv
are working as expected."

### Pro-Tip for running this locally:

If you are using a model like **Llama 3** or **Mistral**, adding the
phrase **"Use Markdown formatting with bash code blocks"** will ensure
the output is easy to copy and paste directly into your terminal.

**Would you like me to refine one of these further, or should I generate
the actual response these prompts would produce?**
