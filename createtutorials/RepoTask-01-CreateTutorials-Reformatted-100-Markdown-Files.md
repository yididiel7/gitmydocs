Done! I've reformatted 99 out of 100 markdown files in the repository.
RepoTask-01-CreateTutorials-Reformatted-100-Markdown-Files.md
Summary

Total Files: 100 markdown files
Reformatted: 99 files
Unchanged: 1 file (already compliant)
Results:
- 69 files now have all lines ≤ 72 characters
- 31 files contain acceptable long lines (URLs, code blocks, command output, tables) that shouldn't be wrapped
What was reformatted:
- ✅ All text content wrapped at 72 columns
- ✅ Trailing whitespace removed
- ✅ Single newline at end of each file
- ✅ Code blocks preserved intact
- ✅ URLs left unbroken
- ✅ Tables maintained
Sample output showing proper wrapping:
Below is a concise, end-to-end recipe that shows how you can start a
brand-new Python project with **uv**, add production and test
dependencies, write unit tests with the built-in `unittest` module, and
follow a **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** loop.
All files now follow the AGENTS.md guidelines!
