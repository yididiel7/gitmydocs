4. POWDER PEARLY SEA

POWDER BLUE HEX #A9DEDA

LIGHT SEA GREEN HEX #2FB5AC

LEMON YELLOW HEX #FAEE4B

PEARLY PURPLE HEX #AE69B3

MAUVE HEX #F4A7FA

Want your branding to make your customers feel like their relaxing on a gulf-coast beach in Florida? That’s exactly how I feel when I take in this color combination (then again, that’s where I grew up – so my tastes are totally biased). The “Powder Blue” and “Light Sea Green” are close enough to “Sea Foam Green” to evoke that same oceanic vibe, while being distinct enough to not feel overused or cliche. These relaxing greens are paired with a nice “Lemon Yellow” for contrast, and rounded out with a calming “Pearly Purple” and more striking “Mauve” purple to create a dynamic swatch panel.

5. SPANISH-FRENCH NEON

ROSE RED HEX #BA3A5E

FRENCH VIOLET HEX #6423CC

ELECTRIC INDIGO HEX #6A23DB

NEON GREEN HEX #09ED15

SPANISH CARMINE HEX #D1174C

When I look at these colors, I see the same boldness one thinks of when they envision the Spaniards or French at the height of their respective world powers. Add in the striking “Neon Green” and you get a powerful and emotional color set that is as unique as it is rich and royal. Use these colors if you want to make your customers feel like royalty, or if you want to make your business feel regal while still appealing to the younger crowd.

6. JEDI BLUE IRISH

HAN BLUE HEX #4C74D9

LEMON CURRY HEX #C99718

CORNFLOWER BLUE HEX #678EF0

ST PATRICKS BLUE HEX #113182

BLUE RYB HEX #1C55E6

I really love this monochromatic blue color set dashed with “Lemon Curry.” I think this color  combination will probably work best as a cinematic palette for photo editing or manipulation, or for some form of color grading in video or illustrative works. These colors could easily be used in a comic book motif or a superhero storyboard. However, these colors are versatile enough to be worked into corporate literature or to create that popular orange-blue contrast in a photo or video.

7. CALIFORNIA HERE I COME

SKY BLUE HEX #88E9FC

REDWOOD HEX #965345

VIVID SKY BLUE HEX #1BD5FA 

PACIFIC BLUE HEX #53A7B8

BITTERSWEET HEX #F27157

It’s not only the names of these swatches that invoke the great state of California, but also the laid-back, borderline earth-tone hues. These colors make me want to jump on a long-board and head to the beach to catch some early morning waves. I recommend using this color combination for organic t-shirt brands, west-coast vibes, or a local hipster clothing outfitter. 

8. SMOKY THE BEAR

SMOKY BLACK HEX #0D0201

RUFOUS HEX #9E2B19

FOREST GREEN TRADITIONAL HEX #014722

SACRAMENTO STATE GREEN HEX #05361C

VERMILLION HEX #E02F14

The next color combination on this list utilize deep earth-tones with an orange “vermillion” accent. Unlike the last color set, which was more of a west-coast surfer vibe, these colors make you want to hike three miles to a camp fire and be one with nature. I recommend this color scheme for outdoor gear companies, nature preserves or state parks, or companies touting environmentally friendly policies and strategies.

9. THE MODERN POLITICIAN

ROSSO CORSA HEX #C42202

VIOLET BLUE HEX #364EC7

NEON BLUE HEX #4967FC

CHARTREUSE TRADITIONAL HEX #DEFC44

PURPLE MUNSELL HEX #9F09BD

Utilizing variations of the primary colors red, blue, and yellow, with a secondary purple color, this color scheme will provide you with myriad opportunities to create eye-catching designs that “pop.” I see the primary colors being used together in a traditional logo, with the purple coming in handy as an accent color in literature or other marketing materials. This swatch panel should have universal appeal – like a major restaurant chain or a political campaign.

10. RUSSIAN POPSTAR

RUSSIAN VIOLET HEX #480259

BRINK PINK HEX #F75979

AMARANTH HEX #E82A50

XIKETIC HEX #0F0104

POPSTAR HEX #C9576E

The last color set on this list is certainly the most unique! It uses shades of pink ending in a darker purple, anchored by the near-black “Xiketic” to invoke sensuality. When I view this palette, it reminds me of something exotic – like a lipstick brand or edgy pizza or donut company (I know that sounds weird, but think “Voodoo Doughnut” or “Sexy Pizza”). If you’re looking to stand out against your competition by using a color set that contrasts with the traditional connotation of your industry, this is the perfect scheme for you. 

That’s it for this list! I recommend bookmarking this article so you can revisit it any time you need inspiration for colors to use in your graphic design projects. You can also use whatever color scheme you decided on in any of my GIMP tutorials or Inkscape tutorials to learn how to create your own unique designs!
