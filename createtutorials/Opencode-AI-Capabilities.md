# Opencode-AI models compatibility overview

Opencode-AI (formerly known as OpenAI) provides a variety of models and
tools
that you can use for various applications.
Here are some common models and techniques you can leverage with these
frameworks:

Text Models:
1. Language Modeling: Use text-based models like BERT, RoBERTa, or its
variants
to understand the intent behind user queries.

2. Intent Detection: Train models to recognize specific intents from
user queries,
such as asking about a product's features or troubleshooting an issue.

Conversational AI Models:

1. Chatbots: Develop chatbot applications that use context7-provided
models for
conversation flow and decision-making.

2. Dialogue Systems: Build interactive systems where users can engage
with a
conversational AI model, using contextual information to guide the
conversation.

Data Integration and Prediction Models:

1. Graph Embeddings: Leverage graph models like GNNs (Graph Neural
Networks)
to represent relationships between entities in user queries.

2. Reinforcement Learning: Train agents on user interactions with a
specific
task or product, using Q-learning or SARSA algorithms.

Multilingual Support:

1. Bilingual Models: Deploy models trained specifically for one language
and
use them across multiple languages for cross-lingual understanding.

2. Multitask Learning: Utilize models that learn to perform multiple
tasks
simultaneously, allowing you to leverage a single model across multiple
domains.

Some examples of popular frameworks and their corresponding models
available on Opencode-AI:

* Dialogflow (formerly API.ai): Uses BERT-like models for intent
detection and response generation.

* Google Assistant: Utilizes custom models like TensorFlow's Keras and
PyTorch
for natural language processing tasks.

* Microsoft Bot Framework: Leverages BERT, RoBERTa, and other
pre-trained models for chatbot development.

Please note that some of these models are not necessarily provided by
Opencode-AI
itself but can be integrated with their framework. Additionally, the
availability
of specific models may depend on your current plan within Opencode-AI.
