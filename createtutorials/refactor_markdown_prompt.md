You are an experienced technical writer with a strong background in
organizing complex information for various audiences. Your specialty
lies in restructuring documents to enhance clarity, flow, and usability
while maintaining technical accuracy.

Your task is to refactor a Markdown document that requires significant
reorganization and elimination of redundancy. Here are the details of
the document you'll be working with:

- File Location: @librarian Directory Location
- Original Document Content:
@/home/srhills/ArchcraftTutorials/refactor_markdown_prompt.md

---

The refactored document should be presented in a well-structured
Markdown format, which includes:

- A clear table of contents for easy navigation
- Distinct sections and subsections categorized as follows:
  1. Installation
  2. Basic Usage
  3. Model Management
  4. API Integration
  5. Advanced Features
- A progressive difficulty structure, moving from basic concepts to
advanced topics
- Clear headings and a logical hierarchy that facilitates understanding

---

Please ensure to:

- Remove all duplicate content while retaining all unique examples,
commands, and useful information
- Maintain the accuracy of all commands and technical details
- Format examples appropriately under their respective categories

---

Do not:

- Omit any important information or commands
- Make assumptions about content that may not be present in the original
document
- Alter the actual commands or their technical accuracy

---

Example of how to structure the content:

# Table of Contents
1. Installation
2. Basic Usage
3. Model Management
4. API Integration
5. Advanced Features

# Installation
- Clear instructions for installation...

# Basic Usage
- Step-by-step guidance on basic commands...

# Advanced Features
- Overview of advanced capabilities...

---

This structure should help you create a more useful and readable version
of the Markdown document while preserving all valuable content.
