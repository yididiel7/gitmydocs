a repository using the GitHub web interface.

What is a GitHub repo?

A GitHub repo (repository) is a place to store your code. It’s like a
folder on your computer, but it’s stored online so you can access it
from anywhere. You can use GitHub to collaborate with others on
projects, or to share your code with the world.

GitHub is a popular choice for software developers because it’s free,
easy to use, and has a large community of users. If you’re a software
developer, I highly recommend using GitHub.

How to create a GitHub repo

Creating a GitHub repo is easy. Just follow these steps:

1. Go to the [GitHub website](https://github.com/) and sign up for an
account.
2. Click the “+” button in the top right corner of the page and select
“New repository.”
3. Give your repo a name and a description.
4. (Optional) Select a license for your repo.
5. Click the “Create repository” button.

Your repo will be created and you’ll be taken to the main page for your
repo. This page will show you a list of all the files in your repo, as
well as a commit history.

You can add files to your repo by clicking the “Add file” button. You
can also commit changes to your repo by clicking the “Commit changes”
button.

For more information on how to use GitHub, I recommend checking out the
[GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/).

GitHub is a powerful tool that can be used to collaborate on projects,
share code, and learn from others. If you’re a software developer, I
highly recommend using GitHub.
